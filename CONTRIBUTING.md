To contribute, look out for the issues raised by the maintainers as well as the other participants for contributions. Comment down your github ID and tell that you're working on the issue.

Make sure your PR is valid, and solves a unique issue rather than an issue already raised by the maintainer/contributors.

LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!
